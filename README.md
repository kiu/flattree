# Be Inspired

Build something beautiful for christmas - be creative - enlighten the dark season.  

# Ingredients

* A few meters 12mm APA102 LED strips (e.g. 3.5 meters of 60 LED/meter strips)
* One [crown](https://github.com/kiu/flattree/tree/master/hardware/crown) PCB
* Multiple [branch](https://github.com/kiu/flattree/tree/master/hardware/branch) PCBs (e.g. 10 for the 3.5 meter setup) 
* Four [stomp](https://github.com/kiu/flattree/tree/master/hardware/stomp) PCBs
* Plyboard (e.g. 600x1200)
* Beefy 5V Power Supply
* Something to spew out 5V SPI data (e.g. a massively overpowered PI Zero with a recycled [5V Level Converter](https://github.com/kiu/hub75shifter/tree/master/hat/rev_a) hat)

# Disclaimer

PCBs are a super cheap solution building this tree silhouette while maintaing a clean look (no dangling wires at the edges). But due to solder burns and PCB thickness it is not as perfect as I would like to.
